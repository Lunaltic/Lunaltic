# 👋 Hallo.
<br>
I started with Minecraft servers and applications in VB.Net on 2015, I also tried creating Minecraft Plugins and other stuff. 💾

Nowadays I'm focused on game and web development, but I still do other things sometimes. Working on my personal website, <a href="https://github.com/lucasofw">click here</a> to see
(when its ready) 🍁

🎮 Trying to finish my games and publish them on steam/play store, but working alone is a bit hard .-.
