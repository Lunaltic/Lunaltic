I started with Minecraft servers and applications in VB.Net on 2015, I also tried creating Minecraft Plugins and other stuff. 💻

Nowadays I'm focused on **game engines/game development**, but I still do other things sometimes. Working on my personal website, <a href="https://lucasof.site" target="blank">click here</a> to see
(Not ready yet) 🍁

Trying to finish my games and publish them on steam/play store, but working alone is a bit hard 🎮
